  index.js               # App entry, routes, providers
  theme.css              # Theme tokens and UI polish
  components/            # Navbar, Footer, Product list, etc.

```

## Getting started

1) Clone the repo

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/rakesh-vajrapu/ShopSmart.git
cd ShopSmart
```

2) Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

3) Run in development

```powershell
npm start
```

4) Build for production

```powershell
npm run build
```

## Scripts

- start: Launches the CRA dev server
- build: Production build to the build/ folder
- test: Run tests (if/when added)

## Tech stack

- React 18, React Router 6
- Redux Toolkit store configuration, classic reducer for cart
- Bootstrap 5 (from node_modules) and Font Awesome 4
- Fake Store API for product data

## Notes and troubleshooting

- Do not include external Bootstrap v4 CDN or jQuery; this project uses Bootstrap 5 from npm. The navbar toggler works via bootstrap.bundle.js already imported in `src/index.js`.
- Icons use Font Awesome v4 classes (e.g., `fa fa-shopping-cart`). We import its CSS from node_modules in `src/index.js`.
- Cart is saved in localStorage under the `cart` key; login status is saved as `isLoggedIn` and the current user under `currentUser`.
- Fake Store API is a public demo service; expect occasional latency.
